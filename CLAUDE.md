- DO NOT EVER USE Datasource directly in a notifier. in the Notifier call a usecase which calls a method in Repository. RepositoryImpl implements the Repository. the method in RepositoryImpl will call the Datasource. Datasource always returns model OR List<model> to the RepositoryImpl method and RepositoryImpl returns it as Entity OR List<Entity> . conversion from Model to Entity will happen in the method in RepositoryImpl using model.toEntity() method.
